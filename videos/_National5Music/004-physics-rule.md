<u>Physics Rule [To verify lyrics]</u>

We say that vectors convey both direction and magnitude,
Combine them in a single line note the angle and you’re all good,
Scalars like time and speed only have a size, it’s all they need,
Plot ‘v’ up against ‘t’ and observe the gradient,
This shows how acceleration goes during the entire event,
To find the overall displacement add up the area of every segment,
Acceleration is the rate of change of speed,
Final minus initial over ‘t’,
To achieve this, you will need an unbalanced force,
Newton’s 2nd law.

See the 1st law, 
When forces balance in free-fall,
Oh Physics Rule,
You are wonderful!

[Equips shades]
[NB. Shades make everything better]

We state you measure your weight using mass times the value of ‘g’,
An action has a reaction and this is law number three,
Potential to kinetic conservation of energy works completely,
Project and object and observe the path is curved,
To ground it accerates down but along ‘v’ is preserved,
A big enough velocity and it will fall right around the earth,
Into orbit.
Moons orbit planets orbit stars,
Stars group up in galaxies like ours,
Exploring space gives GPS, world-wide communication,
And the ISS!
But caution,
There’s also lost of radiation,
And re-entry, 
Can be very risky.

Line spectra,
Give us a much clearer picture,
 Of the elements,
Within a star’s content.

The Big Bang,
The universe’s origin,
Oh Physics Rule,
You are wonderful!
